# CPPSnippetsAndPatterns
Random collection of interesting C++ code snippets/patterns. Will add to this as I come across more.

#### [PassKey](https://github.com/Wh0DKnee/CPPSnippetsAndPatterns/blob/master/PassKey/PassKey.cpp)
* Grant some class access to specific members of another class. Like a friend class, but limiting what the friend can access.

#### [Variant Polymorphism](https://github.com/Wh0DKnee/CPPSnippetsAndPatterns/blob/master/VariantPolymorphism/VariantPolymorphism.cpp)
* C++17 take on polymorphism using std::variant.
